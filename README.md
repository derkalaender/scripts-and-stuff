# Scripts & Stuff

Just a collection of random scripts, lines of code, goodies and drafts for various proposes.
Have fun!

These scripts are probably not supposed to be run as is, but rather be integrated in a bigger project. They generally just resemble an idea I once had.

Every script is **one** file with **one** purpose.

My scripts are categorized by the language they are written in.

At the moment, I've written scripts in these languages:

* ## [Python](/python)
Requires **Python 3.6** in order to work (other 3.something versions might work as well but I've not tested these, as I myself develop in 3.6)
To execute a script, simply run `python3.6 script_name.py` from your bash/command line
